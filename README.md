# Continuous Integration Workshop
This repository contains the learning materials for the workshop on how to create a continuous integration workflow. The skills being taught apply to a variety of languages, tools and setups. But Gradle, Java, Git and Travis CI form the foundation of this workshop.

## What is Continuous Integration (CI)
[Wikipedia][1] tells us that:

>In software engineering, continuous integration (CI) is the practice of merging all developer working copies to a shared mainline several times a day

This however, although true, doesn't really tell us:
 - What CI is trying to achieve and solve
 - How to go about doing CI
 - What the natural consequences of a CI workflow are

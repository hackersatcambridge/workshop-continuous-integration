This workshop covers the fundamentals of continuous integration (CI), which is essentially
the process of automatically building, testing and even deploying a codebase for every
change that is made to it. The skills being taught apply to a variety of languages, tools
and setups. But Gradle, Java, Git and Travis CI form the foundation of this workshop.

It will cover:

- What is continuous integration?
- What needs to be achieved to get a CI workflow?
- What else can be done with CI?
- CI example workflow
- Downsides to CI
